%% Things to do:
% 3. make presentation slides
% 5. document this function
% 6. integrate this same function type into longitudinal model
% 8. update peak Slip ratio in accordance with new tire model?
% 9. round everything to 3 decimal places to make sure that dw is 0 when
% peak force is achieved.
% 10. figure out why slipping is so bad
% 11. determine if smoothening torque is better
% 12. determine if torque map at high end is bad (too steep)
% 13. figure out why suspension is so sus
% 14. figure out why sensitivity to J
% 15. figure out what to do about non monotonic regions for interval
% bisection
% 16. final solution is smooth fsolve, but bisection gives close result
% 17. instead of providing actual slip ratio, provide derivative to relax
% the problem
% 18. remove slip ratio discontinuity by have differentiable slip ratio
