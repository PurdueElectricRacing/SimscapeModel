% TODO:
% 1.  Check Moment Calculations
% 2.  Final Check of derivatives given states
% 5.  Improve output function and plotting function
% 7.  Change sample space for skidpad
% 8.  check vehicle parameters against actual vehicle
% 10. Figure out how to limit applied torque to enable always solving for steady state
% 11. Analyze choice steady state yaw rate conditions
% 12. Verify that symmetry is preserved for +- steering angle
% 13. save time, all simulation data instead of just choice data
% 14. Talk with VD modeling to see what can be improved
% 15. Figure out other tests to ensure model is accurate
% 18. Add controller module, for velocity control / path tracking
% 19. Validate against testing data

MODELING:
1. Add combined tire model
2. Add in derating function to motors
3. Add anti-roll bar
4. Add regen to model

DONE:
% 3.  Fully comment out the code - functions commented as they are
% 6.  Take average of last few second to get better measuremnet of V, dyaw: fixing 9 fixes 6
% 9.  Figure out why small oscilation about steady state: incorrect velocity transform
